// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const Analysis_Of_Requirements = "State clearly exactly what the program needs to accomplish so that all developers are on the same page. Decide the specifics of what needs to be done."

const Design = "a high level concept of the code - determining the flow of the code and what variables it will need."

const Implementation = "The actual code! Making the actual code that you need"

const Testing_and_Integration = "Testing the code; running it and making sure it works. Pushing it out to the world and having it go live. Making sure it works with everything else that has come before this."

const Maintain = "any changes that need to be made to it later down the line. Bug fixes, and also if anything needs changes due to updates from other parts of the software or hardware"
